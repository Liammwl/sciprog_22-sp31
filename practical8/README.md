Write a function that returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a pair of integers passed as
arguments. The GCD of two or more non-zero integers, is the largest positive integer that divides
the numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4. A convenient way to
find the GCD of two integers is to use the euclidian algorithm.

1. Use the pseudo code to construct an iterative function.
2. Construct a recursive function to do the same, using the formula below the pseudo code.
