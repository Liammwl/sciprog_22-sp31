Calculate the values of tan(x) where x is in radians in the range [0, 60] every five degrees. Place the results in an array. Print the array. Make the array a global variable.

1. Use the function (or subroutine) from the third lecture in Week 4, to convert degrees to radians.
2. Construct main, in main have a loop where the loop counter does 0, 1, 2 · · · 12.
3. Use the loop counter to generate the degree angles.
4. Use the function to generate the radian values.
5. Compute tan(x), store in the array.
 
Create a function/subroutine that calculates the area under the curve of tan(x) from 0 → 60degrees using the Trapezoidal Rule. (You did this last week).

• There should be one argument, the number of points, and the return value is the area.
• When compiling with C use #include < math.h > and compile with “-lm”. This will ensure the tan function is available.


the answer is  0.695045
the actual value is 0.693147
